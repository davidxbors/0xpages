# 🔍 Penetration Testing & Offensive Security
*Cut through the noise. Break things before attackers do.*

---

## What I Do  

### **Network Assessments**  
Full‑stack discovery, vulnerability mapping, exploit validation, and an exploit‑proof remediation roadmap.  

### **Web App Assessments**  
OWASP‑aligned black‑, grey‑, or white‑box testing with business‑logic abuse coverage and proof‑of‑concept exploits.  

### **Red Team Scenarios**  
Adversary simulation (MITRE ATT&CK), stealthy post‑exploitation, and executive red–blue debriefs.  

### **Mobile App Assessments**  
Static + dynamic testing on iOS & Android, API fuzzing, jailbreak/root bypass checks, secure‑storage validation.  

### **Secure Coding Review**  
Automated SAST + manual code review with contextual risk scoring and fix‑first prioritization.  

### **SecOps**  
Designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines with integrated security scanning, automated vulnerability management, and IaC security hardening.  

### **Smart Contract Auditing**  
In-depth review of Solidity, Rust, or other smart contract code to identify vulnerabilities, ensure logic integrity, and optimize gas usage.

## My Approach  
1. **Recon & Threat Modeling** – Understand what truly matters to your business.  
2. **Exploit‑Driven Testing** – Focus on *impact*, not just CVSS scores.  
3. **No‑BS Reporting** – Crystal‑clear, exec‑ready briefs + developer‑friendly remediation tasks.  
4. **Rapid Re‑Test** – Validate fixes fast and certify closure.
