			<strong>tl;dr:</strong>
			A wierd glitch when refreshing the page of a webapp made me look into its potential cause. After digging into it I discovered the glitch was caused by the fact that the app was loading its privileged view by default, and some miliseconds later, it made a request to the API to check the actual privileges of the user. Further on, this helped me discovered API endpoints that were accesible for unauthenticated users.

			<h2 id="glitches-in-the-matrix">Glitches in the matrix</h2>
<p>In Summer 2023 I had to use my university&rsquo;s webapp dedicated for the facultative courses choosing.
Right away from the first interaction with the website after logging in, something struck me.
Everytime I accessed / refreshed the page, for a fraction of a second it seemed that more buttons were displayed in the navbar.
This seemed interesting to look into, so I decided to look into it.</p>
<p>At first, I was expecting this to be some framework glitch - some delayed rendering or anything similar to this.
So, I started looking into the source code.
However, there was nothing interesting there.
Just the way a navbar should normally look.</p>
<p>I thought maybe there are some external resources loading with a delay so I fired up Burp and proxied the traffic.
Looking through the requests I saw many requests to the <code>/api/</code> endpoint made in the first miliseconds after refreshing the page.
One request seemed really interesting, and that was a GET request to the <code>/api/AcademicUser/GetRolesForUser</code> - so I decided to look into it.</p>
<h2 id="going-into-the-rabbit-hole">Going into the Rabbit Hole</h2>
<p>The request looked like this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span style="display:flex;"><span>GET /api/AcademicUser/GetRolesForUser HTTP/2
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Host: &lt;redacted&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Authorization: &lt;redacted&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Ok, nothing to pwn here&hellip; But how does the response look like?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span style="display:flex;"><span>HTTP/2 200 OK
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>...
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"></span>[
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &#34;Student&#34;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Could it be that the client-side renders a privileged view by default, and then updates it once it gets notified the current user is not privileged?
Let&rsquo;s intercept the response and fuzz it.</p>
<p>After fuzzing, I had a winner: <code>Admin</code>.
Everytime I replaced <code>Student</code> with <code>Admin</code>, I would get a privileged view of the application.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/imgs/student_view.png" alt="student view of the app">
<em>Student view of the app</em></p>
<p><img src="/posts/imgs/admin_view.png" alt="admin view of the app">
<em>Admin view of the app</em></p>
<p><img src="/posts/imgs/admin_view2.png" alt="admin view of the app 2">
<em>Admin configurations</em></p>
<h2 id="the-final-piece-of-the-puzzle">The Final Piece of the Puzzle</h2>
<p>Viewing some buttons is something, but actually using them is something else.
The question was if I was limited to only getting a privileged view or I could execute privileged actions.
The response was that I could perform any action I was exposed to.</p>
<p>This lead me to an even more interesting hypothesis: if the server-side doesn&rsquo;t realize that I should not be able to access these API endpoints, does it even realize if the user making the request is authenticated or not?
The short answer: no.</p>
<h2 id="impact">IMPACT</h2>
<p>The impact of this vulnerability was quite big. Not only did I have access to data I shouldn&rsquo;t have access to, I could modify that data to.
Being able to change the attendence lists for the future courses is, in my opinion at least, a serious matter.
Of course, if someone used this to cause mayhem students would&rsquo;ve probably noticed it and reported the issue, and the repartisation would&rsquo;ve been remade.
However, if someone made small changes&hellip;</p>
<p>After discovering the vulnerability I reported it to the admin of this asset and they fixed the issue.
I retested it after some months and I must say they did a good job! (that is: there were no JWT vulns and the JWT was actually checked this time)</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p>The main takeaways I got from this were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always secure your API endpoints, DUH!</li>
<li>Sometimes, its worth looking into things that seem wierd to you even when you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll discover much from them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, those API endpoints could&rsquo;ve been discovered by using a URL Fuzzer too, but harder and in a more noisy way.
Also, they had some custom names that I think most wordlists don&rsquo;t include.</p>
<p>PS: This writeup doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of pics and evidence as I didn&rsquo;t save many. At the time I didn&rsquo;t have this project (the blog) in mind. I only found a screen record I sent to the admin and took screenshots of it.</p>
