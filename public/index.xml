      <description>Finding about the CVE and starting to binwalk I found about this CVE on 23 July, while scrolling on my phone. DNSC published an aricle about two critical vulnerabilities in CISCO. CVE-2024-20419 stood out to me as it had a 10.0 CVSS score, and yet I found out about it almost a week after it was published. Also, at a quick search I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any public POC for it.</description>

      <description>Glitches in the matrix In Summer 2023 I had to use my university&amp;rsquo;s webapp dedicated for the facultative courses choosing. Right away from the first interaction with the website after logging in, something struck me. Everytime I accessed / refreshed the page, for a fraction of a second it seemed that more buttons were displayed in the navbar. This seemed interesting to look into, so I decided to look into it.</description>

      <description>This story began with me reading this great article [1], from John Stawinski. My mind imediately wandered to workflows that I use on daily basis and how could they be compromised. A workflow used frequently by me and thousands of other users is the checker workflow from our uni&amp;rsquo;s assignment repository.&#xA;What is a checker workflow? For most of our coding assignments, we have checkers, that check if the submitted implementation meets the standard given in the assignment.</description>
